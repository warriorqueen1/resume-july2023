    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Reading</h3>
            <p>I really love to read. I enjoy all kind of books from fictions to nonfictions except for textbooks. I can read up to 150 books a year but I mostly read all kind of genres for fiction books, but I would accompany it with non-fiction books. </p>
        </li>

        <h3><li>Book reviewing</h3> 
            <p>After reading any books, I would review it in order to better memorize the content. If you are looking for book recommendation, I am the girl that can help you.</p>
        </li>
        <h3><li>Learning something new</h3> 
            <p>I am currently learning python and web development from the internet (using the udemy website)</p>
        </li>
        <h3><li>Archery</h3> 
            <p>This is one of the hobby that I wish I can do more. I'm going to practice more on it once I got the bow and arrow.</p>
        </li>
        <h3><li>Sports</h3> 
            <p>I never went a day without exercising. Usually, when I'm not busy, I would spend 2 hours a day to exercise (start from stretching or yoga, and then I would run or swim). If I goes one day without exercising, I would have too much excess energy and I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.</p>
